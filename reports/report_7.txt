### Weekly Health and Fitness Report

#### Overview:
This week's health data shows a progressive increase in physical activity and energy expenditure. Each day, there was a consistent improvement in steps taken, walking and running distance, and flights climbed. Notably, there's a slight increase in walking asymmetry and double support percentage, which might need attention to ensure balanced mobility.

#### Key Metrics Analysis:
- *Steps & Activity:*
  - Total steps this week: 41,800
  - Total walking/running distance: 28.7 km
  - Total flights climbed: 28

- *Heart Health:*
  - Average resting heart rate data available: 74.5 bpm (on days recorded)
  - Heart rate readings were missing on some days, which might affect the accuracy of the average.

- *Energy Levels:*
  - Total active energy burned: 1,610 calories
  - Total basal energy burned: 13,650 calories
  - A consistent increase in both active and basal energy burned suggests improved metabolic rates.

- *Mobility:*
  - Walking speed increased from 1.2 m/s to 1.8 m/s
  - Step length improved from 0.75 m to 1.05 m
  - Increases in walking asymmetry (from 15.0% to 19.8%) and double support (from 22.0% to 28.6%) could indicate potential gait issues.

- *Audio Exposure:*
  - Average daily headphone audio exposure: 76.4 dB
  - Exposure levels are fairly consistent, suggesting regular use of headphones at a potentially safe volume.

#### Weekly Comparison:
Since last week's summary is not available, direct comparison trends cannot be provided. Focus remains on this week's progressive data.

#### Recommendations & Tips:
- *Mobility:* Consider exercises aimed at improving gait symmetry and reducing double support time, such as balance drills or targeted strength training.
- *Heart Health:* Ensure daily monitoring of heart rate to maintain comprehensive data for accurate health assessments.
- *Activity Levels:* Aim to gradually increase daily steps and incorporate varied cardiovascular activities like cycling or swimming to enhance overall fitness.
- *Audio Health:* Maintain awareness of audio exposure levels and consider reducing volume or using noise-cancelling options to preserve hearing health.
